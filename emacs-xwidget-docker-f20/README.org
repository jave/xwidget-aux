* an xwidget emacs docker recipy

To ensure builds work in clean environments, one can use this docker.

its also possible to run the xwidget emacs in the docker, but you need to forward X.

either install ssh in the container, or use this method:

xhost +
docker run -it -v /tmp/.X11-unix/X76:/tmp/.X11-unix/X76 --env DISPLAY=:76 d18554142086  /xwidget/src/emacs

adapt to your environment of course. Notice that the xhost+ is totally insecure.
